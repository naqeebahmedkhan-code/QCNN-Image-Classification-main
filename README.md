# QCNN-Image-Classification-main
Image classification is crucial in computer vision. While CNNs excel, QCNNs leverage quantum principles for potential gains. This project explores QCNNs using IBMâ€™s quantum simulator and PennyLane, benchmarking them against CNNs on MNIST. Various QCNN architectures, circuits, and quanvolutional layers are studied for performance evaluation.
